In this, I attempted to create an neural network that can identify chess pieces.
All the chess pieces were imported from lichess.org

In ImportFilenames.py, you must import all the chess piece jpgs. I couldn't figure out how to upload the entire file, so I added a google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1lYybMR0AK9fFyGkbtsLCEEvr4CRduPt3 
From this link, install the files inside jpg_piece_abhilash and jpg_piece_achintya, and put the file path into ImportFilenames.py at line 7.
